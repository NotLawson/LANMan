# LANMan
> As of now, this is only an idea. Code in this repository (if any) should be treated as not working.

LANMan is a LAN party manager that (should) allow for many people to use different local servers. 

## Features
- Game server management: Pick and choose which game servers to run at your party
- Account Linking: Automatic login to game clients if a player switches PC
- PC Management: Track what's being played on which computer, and manage the games/clients/apps installed
- Voice Chat: Set up VC rooms that players can connect to
- Events Manager and notifier: Notify players when events are going to start and manage tournaments and competitions

## Use cases I can imagine
- Game tournaments: Designate groups of pc for players and automatically log them in, local game servers for minimal lag, voice chat for teams and the tournament manager to manage standings
- Game demo events: Manage the games that are being played on the PCs
- LAN party: Allow players to log in and play their games with voice chat
- Esports: Run tournaments, voice chat, automatic login and game servers

## How this would work
Heavily influenced by OpenSourceLAN, which seems to be abandoned, it will mainly run in containers.
